    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      If a HSTS header is required through settings in the default cluster ingress
      it may happen that routes are automatically created by other resources
      and the header could not be set directly in the configuration (e.g. some operators).
      This clusterpolicy will add the HSTS header to all routes that are created or
      updated in the namespace "openshift-gitops".
      This additional clusterpolicy was created because the main policy for HSTS headers
      will not apply to all namespaces beginning with "openshift".
      IMPORTANT: The setting "schemaValidation: false" is because of a bug in the actual
      kyverno version and can be deleted in 1.9+.
